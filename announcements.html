      <h1>Announcements</h1>
        <p>We hope that you have a pleasant and safe trip to Vienna and wish to request that you please take a few minutes to read the following useful information.</p> 
        <p>Before travelling, make sure if you need a visa to come to Vienna and that you are carrying a valid passport.</p>
        <p>DO NOT ride a taxi outside the airport. There are several taxi companies which you can hire before leaving Immigration. Stay tuned for updates on affordable local transport.</p>
        <h3>HOTELS:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The Congress has special rates on 3 hotels but you need to book them through our web page when you register</li>                  
            <li>We will have return transportation from these hotels to the Congress site (PUCP’s campus) and we will provide timetables and schedules.</li> 
            <li>When arriving at the hotel, hand your passport to the receptionist. They need to photocopy it so that you can get the international visitor’s tax exemption.</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>WEATHER:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>During the month of July, temperatures in Austria reach between 81°F to 61°F (27ºC - 18ºC.). You might need to bring clothes to keep cool because it can also get humid.</li> 
          </ul>
        <h3>HEALTH:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Please stay hydrated and drink only bottled water as tap water is not recommended.</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>ATTIRE:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Casual clothes during the meeting.</li> 
          </ul>
        <h3>TIPPING:</h3>

            <li>Most restaurants include a 10% tip. The total should be around 15%. Doorkeepers should be tipped USD$ 2 per bag. Taxi drivers do not expect a tip.</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>HANDICRAFTS:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Austrian handicrafts such as fine textiles, paintings, jewelry and pottery can be found in shops near the hotels.</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>GASTRONOMY:</h3> 
          <ul>
           <li>Vienna is very well known for its great food. Although Austrian food may be a little different than American, it is very tasty. Don’t miss trying its renowned plates.</li>

          </ul>
        <h3>SECURITY ADVISE:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Vienna shares the same problems which plague any large city but if you use your common sense and have a little precaution you can avoid being a victim of any incident.</li>
            <li>We suggest you leave your passport, airticket and valuables in the hotel´s safety box. Always carry a photocopy of your passport.</li> 
            <li>At the Airport, please keep your luggage at sight. Taxis in Vienna have no taximeters. Make sure to negotiate an amount before you take one.</li>
